# siamese_embeddings
An investigation into how different embeddings effect siamese networks - Currently only a USE(Universal sentence Encoder) Model has been created, but other version will be available once the projectis finished. From the time of writing this, my computer has slowed down excessively which has halted the project as it is. 

There were custom layers, however because of the size of the project they were removed to focus on testing embeddings and getting enough metrics for a report. The next investigations will be on NN weights, custom loss functions and merging methods.
